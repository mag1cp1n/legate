/**
 * @ingroup data
 *
 * @brief A multi-dimensional data container
 *
 * `LogicalStore` is a multi-dimensional data container for fixed-size elements. Stores are
 * internally partitioned and distributed across the system. By default, Legate clients need
 * not create nor maintain the partitions explicitly, and the Legate runtime is responsible
 * for managing them. Legate clients can control how stores should be partitioned for a given
 * task by attaching partitioning constraints to the task (see the constraint module for
 * partitioning constraint APIs).
 *
 * Each logical store object is a logical handle to the data and is not immediately associated
 * with a physical allocation. To access the data, a client must `map` the store to a physical
 * store (`PhysicalStore`). A client can map a store by passing it to a task, in which case the task
 * body can see the allocation, or calling `get_physical_store`, which gives the client a handle
 * to the physical allocation (see `PhysicalStore` for details about physical stores).
 *
 * Normally, a logical store gets a fixed shape upon creation. However, there is a special type of
 * logical stores called `unbound` stores whose shapes are unknown at creation time. (see `Runtime`
 * for the logical store creation API.) The shape of an unbound store is determined by a task that
 * first updates the store; upon the submission of the task, the logical store becomes a normal
 * store. Passing an unbound store as a read-only argument or requesting a physical store of an
 * unbound store are invalid.
 *
 * One consequence due to the nature of unbound stores is that querying the shape of a previously
 * unbound store can block the client's control flow for an obvious reason; to know the shape of
 * the logical store whose shape was unknown at creation time, the client must wait until the
 * updater task to finish. However, passing a previously unbound store to a downstream operation can
 * be non-blocking, as long as the operation requires no changes in the partitioning and mapping for
 * the logical store.
